My research interests include: *social media marketing, digital markets, and cross-platform advertising*. Before joining Emory as a doctoral student, I was at the **University of Wisconsin - Madison**, where I got my MBA in Marketing Research from the **A.C. Nielsen Center for Marketing Analytics and Insights**.
