I'm a PhD student in Quantitative Marketing at [**Goizueta Business School, Emory University**](https://goizueta.emory.edu/). My research interests include: *Social Media Marketing, Digital Markets, and Cross-platform Advertising*. Before joining Emory as a doctoral student, I was at the [University of Wisconsin - Madison](https://bus.wisc.edu/), where I got my MBA in Marketing Research and MS in Business Analytics degrees from the [A.C. Nielsen Center for Marketing Analytics and Insights](https://bus.wisc.edu/centers/ac-nielsen-center-marketing-analytics-insights).
