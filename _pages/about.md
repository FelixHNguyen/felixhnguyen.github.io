My research interests include: *Social Media Marketing, Digital Markets, and Cross-platform Advertising*. Before joining Emory as a doctoral student, I was at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, where I got my MBA in Marketing Research from the A.C. Nielsen Center for Marketing Analytics and Insights.
